# Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator

## Overview
In this chapter, we explore the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator**, another free tool provided by Azure. Unlike the Pricing Calculator, the TCO Calculator focuses on estimating potential savings when migrating workloads from on-premises data centers to Azure.

## Key Topics Covered
### 1. **Introduction to TCO Calculator**
   - **Purpose**: 
     - Helps estimate the cost benefits of moving workloads to Azure.
     - Assists in building a business case for migration.
   - **Accessibility**: 
     - Free to use, no Azure account required.
     - Available online alongside the Pricing Calculator.

---

### 2. **Use Cases for TCO Calculator**
   - Evaluate potential savings when migrating:
     - Servers.
     - Databases.
     - Storage and networking workloads.
   - Justify cloud adoption by assessing:
     - Cost savings over time.
     - Benefits of new technologies unavailable on-premises.
     - Long-term financial impact.

### 3. **Steps to Use the TCO Calculator**
1. **Define Workloads**:
   - Add details of on-premises resources:
     - **Servers**: 
       - Number of servers.
       - Processors per server.
       - Cores per processor.
       - RAM size.
     - **Databases**:
       - Type (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server).
       - Azure migration option (e.g., Azure SQL Database with vCore model).
     - **Storage**:
       - Storage capacity (e.g., 1 TB for backup and archive).
       - Destination region.
       - Outbound bandwidth.
   
2. **Adjust Assumptions**:
   - Modify assumptions related to:
     - Enterprise agreements with Microsoft (e.g., Windows Server, SQL Server licensing).
     - Current on-premises costs for:
       - Hardware.
       - Software.
       - Virtualization.
       - IT labor.

3. **Generate Report**:
   - The calculator provides a **five-year cost comparison**:
     - **On-premises costs**: Estimated costs of continuing with existing infrastructure.
     - **Azure costs**: Projected costs after migration.
     - **Savings**: Potential financial benefits over the five-year period.

### 4. **Benefits of Using the TCO Calculator**
   - Provides a **rough estimate** of cost savings.
   - Helps businesses identify:
     - Cost reductions in IT operations.
     - Advantages of adopting Azure services over maintaining on-premises infrastructure.
   - Facilitates the creation of a solid **business case** for cloud migration.

---

## Summary
- The **TCO Calculator** is a valuable tool for organizations considering cloud migration.
- It helps estimate potential savings by comparing on-premises costs with Azure costs over a five-year period.
- By customizing workload and cost assumptions, businesses can gain actionable insights to support their decision-making process.
