# Azure Resource Locks

## Overview
In this chapter, we explore **Resource Locks**, a security feature in Azure that helps protect resources from accidental deletion or modification.

---

## Key Topics Covered
### 1. **Understanding Resource Locks**
   - **Purpose**:
     - Prevents accidental deletion or modification of resources.
     - Ensures critical infrastructure remains protected.
   - **Levels of Lock Application**:
     - **Subscription Level**: Applies to all resource groups and resources under the subscription.
     - **Resource Group Level**: Applies to all resources within the resource group.
     - **Resource Level**: Applies to a specific resource only.

---

### 2. **Types of Resource Locks**
1. **CanNotDelete Lock**:
   - Users can **read and modify** a resource.
   - **Deletion is restricted**.
   - Prevents accidental or unauthorized deletion of critical resources.

2. **ReadOnly Lock**:
   - Users can **only read** the resource.
   - **Modification and deletion are restricted**.
   - Ensures that configurations remain unchanged.

### 3. **Creating a Resource Lock**
1. Navigate to **Azure Portal**.
2. Select a **resource, resource group, or subscription**.
3. Go to the **Locks** section.
4. Click **Add Lock**.
5. Choose the **Lock Type**:
   - **ReadOnly**
   - **CanNotDelete**
6. Assign a **lock name** and click **OK**.

---

### 4. **Testing Resource Locks**
- **Example**: Applying a **ReadOnly** lock on a Virtual Machine.
  - If you attempt to **stop** the machine, the operation **fails**.
  - This happens because stopping the machine modifies its state, which is restricted by the lock.

---

### 5. **Removing a Resource Lock**
- To allow modifications or deletions:
  1. Navigate to **Locks**.
  2. Select the lock.
  3. Click **Delete**.
  4. The resource is now unlocked and can be modified or deleted.

---

## Summary
- **Resource Locks** prevent **accidental deletions and modifications** of Azure resources.
- Locks can be applied at the **Subscription, Resource Group, or Resource Level**.
- Two lock types:
  - **CanNotDelete**: Prevents deletion but allows modifications.
  - **ReadOnly**: Prevents both deletion and modifications.
- **To modify a locked resource,** the lock must first be removed.

**Tip**: Use **Resource Locks** to safeguard critical infrastructure and avoid unintended disruptions.
