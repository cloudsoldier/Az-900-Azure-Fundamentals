#  Introduction to Azure Monitor

---

## **1. Overview of Azure Monitor**
- **Purpose**:  
  A centralized service for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry data from Azure resources, applications, and infrastructure.  
- **Key Capabilities**:  
  - **Metrics**: Track performance data (e.g., CPU usage, memory, disk I/O).  
  - **Alerts**: Trigger notifications based on predefined conditions.  
  - **Logs**: Collect and analyze log data via **Log Analytics Workspace**.  
  - **Visualization**: Build dashboards and reports for insights.  

---

## **2. Key Components of Azure Monitor**
### **A. Metrics**
- **What are Metrics?**  
  Numerical values representing resource performance over time (e.g., VM CPU utilization, storage account transactions).  
- **Example**:  
  Monitor a VM’s CPU usage to identify performance bottlenecks.  

### **B. Alerts**
- **Functionality**:  
  Notify teams when metrics cross thresholds (e.g., VM CPU > 80% for 5 minutes).  
- **Setup**:  
  1. Define alert conditions (metric + threshold).  
  2. Configure **Action Groups** (email, SMS, ITSM integration).  
- **Example**:  
  Send an email to IT admins if a VM’s CPU exceeds 90%.  

### **C. Log Analytics Workspace**
- **Purpose**:  
  Central repository for log data (e.g., event logs, custom application logs).  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Troubleshoot errors across resources.  
  - Query logs using **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**.  

### **D. Visualization Tools**
- **Azure Dashboards**:  
  Create custom dashboards to visualize metrics and logs.  
- **Workbooks**:  
  Interactive reports combining data from multiple sources.

## **3. Use Cases**
### **Scenario 1: Monitor VM Performance**
1. **Collect Metrics**: Track CPU, memory, and disk usage.  
2. **Set Alerts**: Notify admins if usage exceeds thresholds.  
3. **Analyze Logs**: Investigate performance trends in Log Analytics.  

### **Scenario 2: Track Application Health**
- Use **Application Insights** (part of Azure Monitor) to monitor:  
  - Request rates.  
  - Failure rates.  
  - Dependency tracking (e.g., APIs, databases).

## **4. Integration with Azure Services**
- **Supported Resources**:  
  Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, SQL Databases, Web Apps, etc.  
- **Unified Monitoring**:  
  Correlate data across resources for end-to-end visibility.  

---

## **5. AZ-900 Exam Focus Areas**
- **Understand Core Features**:  
  Metrics, alerts, logs, dashboards.  
- **Role in Governance**:  
  Ensure compliance, optimize costs, and improve reliability.  
- **Basic Querying**:  
  Use KQL for log analysis (conceptual understanding only for AZ-900).  

---

## **6. Example: Create a CPU Alert for a VM**
1. **Navigate to Azure Monitor** > **Alerts**.  
2. **New Alert Rule**:  
   - **Condition**: VM CPU percentage > 80% for 5 minutes.  
   - **Action Group**: Email IT team.  
3. **Save**: Alert triggers notifications when condition is met.  

---

## **7. Best Practices**
1. **Enable Monitoring Early**:  
   Configure metrics and logs during resource deployment.  
2. **Use Built-in Workbooks**:  
   Leverage pre-built templates for common scenarios (e.g., VM performance).  
3. **Retention Policies**:  
   Adjust log retention periods to balance cost and compliance.

## **8. Summary**
- Azure Monitor is essential for **proactive management** of Azure resources.  
- Combines **metrics**, **alerts**, **logs**, and **visualization** for full-stack observability.  
- Critical for optimizing performance, cost, and security in cloud environments.
