# Introduction to Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed database service provided by Microsoft. It supports both **NoSQL** and **relational database systems**, which means it can handle modern, flexible data as well as traditional, structured data. The best part? Microsoft takes care of all the hardware and server management, so you can focus on using the database.

## Why Use Azure Cosmos DB?

In the past, relational databases like **SQL Server** or **MySQL** were very common. They used structured tables and required a strict design (schema) to store data, which worked well for certain applications. However, as modern apps evolved, they needed faster, simpler, and more flexible ways to store and retrieve data. This is where **NoSQL databases** became popular—they prioritize speed and flexibility over rigid data relationships.

## What Makes Azure Cosmos DB Special?

Azure Cosmos DB brings **NoSQL databases** to the cloud and supports multiple types of databases, depending on your needs:

1. **NoSQL API**: Stores data as documents (great for modern apps).
2. **MongoDB API**: Ideal if you're already using MongoDB and want to move it to Azure.
3. **PostgreSQL API**: A cloud version of the popular PostgreSQL database.
4. **Apache Cassandra API**: For column-oriented databases.
5. **Gremlin API**: For graph-based databases, useful for social networks or recommendation systems.
6. **Table API**: Stores data in a simple key-value format.

## Why Choose Azure Cosmos DB?

1. **Flexibility**: Choose the database type and API that fits your app's needs.
2. **Global Availability**: Access your data quickly from anywhere in the world.
3. **Fully Managed**: No need to worry about hardware or maintenance—Azure does it for you.
