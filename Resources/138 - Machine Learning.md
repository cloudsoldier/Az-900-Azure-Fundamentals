## Introduction
The Azure Machine Learning service is a key tool in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). ML is a subset of AI, enabling systems to learn from data and mathematical models, while Deep Learning further simulates the human brain's ability to recognize complex patterns.

## Key Concepts
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Machines simulate user actions.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Systems learn using data and models.
- **Deep Learning:** Advances pattern recognition by mimicking the human brain.

## Use Case Scenarios
1. **Fraud Detection in Banking:**
   - Identify valid or fraudulent transactions using ML.
   - Parameters considered:
     - Transaction amount.
     - User's transaction history.
     - Location of the transaction.

2. **Object Recognition:**
   - ML models can identify and categorize objects.

3. **Medical Applications:**
   - Predict potential heart diseases based on a patientâ€™s medical history.

## Next Steps
The next chapter will demonstrate how to use the Machine Learning service on the Azure platform.
