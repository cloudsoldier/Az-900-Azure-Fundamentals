# Lecture Notes: Building a Data Warehousing Solution on Azure

## Overview
In this lecture, we will explore Azure services that help build an **enterprise data warehouse**. Companies today generate large volumes of data and aim to analyze it to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Key Concepts in Data Warehousing

1. **Data Ingestion and Storage**:
   - Companies deal with a variety of incoming data:
     - **Streaming data**: Application logs, server logs, IoT data, etc.
     - **Application data**: Data generated by various business applications.
   - **Azure Data Lake**:
     - Acts as a central repository to store all incoming data.
     - Stores raw data for future processing.

2. **Data Ingestion Tools**:
   - **Azure Stream Analytics**:
     - Processes streaming data in real-time.
   - **Azure Synapse Analytics Pipelines**:
     - Creates ETL pipelines to ingest and store data in services like Azure Storage (data lake).

3. **Data Preparation and Processing**:
   - **Azure Databricks**:
     - Prepares and processes the data for analysis.
     - Trains and transforms raw data into structured data.

4. **Data Storage**:
   - **Azure SQL Data Warehouse**:
     - Stores the processed data in a relational format.
     - Optimized for querying and reporting.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Power BI**:
     - Generates interactive reports and dashboards.
     - Enables users to analyze data stored in the SQL data warehouse.

## Example Workflow for an Enterprise Data Warehouse

1. **Ingest Data**:
   - Use **Azure Stream Analytics** to capture streaming data.
   - Store the data in an **Azure Data Lake** (using Azure Storage).

2. **Prepare Data**:
   - Process the data with **Azure Databricks** to clean, transform, and prepare it for analysis.

3. **Store Data**:
   - Load the processed data into an **Azure SQL Data Warehouse**.

4. **Analyze and Report**:
   - Use **Power BI** to create reports and dashboards based on the data in the data warehouse.
