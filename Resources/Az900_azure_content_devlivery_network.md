## Key Concepts

### What is Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)?
Azure CDN is a service that helps distribute network content across the world to improve performance, reduce latency, and enhance the user experience for web applications.

---

### Why Use Azure CDN?

1. **Improve Response Time**:
   - A web application hosted in a specific region, like **North Europe**, may provide low latency to users near that region.
   - Users located far away, such as in **East US**, may experience higher latency due to the physical distance between the user and the web application.

2. **Global Accessibility**:
   - Azure CDN ensures that users worldwide receive faster response times, regardless of their location, by caching content closer to them.

---

### How Does Azure CDN Work?

1. **Point of Presence (PoP) Locations**:
   - Azure CDN uses PoP locations distributed globally to cache content and serve it closer to the users.

2. **Caching Responses**:
   - When a user in a remote location (e.g., East US) requests a webpage for the first time, the CDN fetches the content from the web app (hosted in North Europe) and caches it at the nearest PoP location.
   - For subsequent requests for the same content, the response is served directly from the cached copy at the PoP location, reducing response time.

3. **Seamless Experience**:
   - By caching content at PoP locations, Azure CDN ensures that users worldwide experience similar low latency and fast response times when accessing the web application.

## Benefits of Azure CDN

1. **Reduced Latency**:
   - Faster delivery of content to users in remote locations.
2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Enhanced speed for web applications globally.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Handles high traffic and ensures consistent performance.
4. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - Reduces load on the original web application by serving cached content.
