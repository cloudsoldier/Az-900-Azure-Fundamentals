# Notes and Lab: Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra ID

## Overview
**Conditional Access** in Microsoft Entra ID provides advanced security by enforcing access policies based on specific conditions. It enhances security by applying additional controls beyond the initial authentication process.

---

## Key Features of Conditional Access
1. **Extra Signals**:
   - Adds conditions such as location, device, or group membership for granting resource access.
2. **Dynamic Policies**:
   - Policies can target specific users, groups, or applications.
3. **Advanced Control**:
   - Requires **Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 licenses** for access to Conditional Access features.

---

## Use Cases
- Restricting access to trusted IP addresses or locations.
- Requiring specific devices enrolled in Microsoft Entra ID.
- Enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) based on user roles or resource types.

---

## Steps to Create and Test Conditional Access Policies

### Prerequisite
- Ensure **Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 licenses** are activated for your account.

---

### Lab: Creating a Conditional Access Policy

#### Step 1: Access Conditional Access
1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) as the **admin account**.
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
3. Click **+ New policy** to create a new Conditional Access policy.

---

#### Step 2: Configure the Policy
1. **Name the Policy**:
   - Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `PolicyA_MFA_Enforcement`).

2. **Assignments**:
   - **Users and Groups**:
     - Select specific users or groups (e.g., `UserA` or a group of administrators).
   - **Cloud Apps or Actions**:
     - Select the target application (e.g., **Microsoft Admin Portals** for Azure management).
   - **Conditions**:
     - Add conditions like:
       - Location-based access (e.g., restrict to trusted IP ranges).
       - Device compliance (e.g., devices joined to Microsoft Entra ID).
     - For simplicity, skip conditions in this lab.

3. **Grant Controls**:
   - Under **Grant**, select **Require multi-factor authentication**.
   - Click **Select** to confirm.

4. **Enable the Policy**:
   - Turn the policy **On** and click **Create** to save it.

---

#### Step 3: Test the Policy
1. Open a new browser or incognito window.
2. Log in as the user specified in the policy (e.g., `UserA`).
3. Enter the username and password.
4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The user is prompted to verify their identity using MFA.
   - If the user is not already registered for MFA, they will be required to set it up.
5. Complete the MFA process (e.g., entering a code sent to the user's mobile device).

---

#### Step 4: Cleanup
1. Return to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
2. Locate the created policy (e.g., `PolicyA_MFA_Enforcement`).
3. Open the policy, click the **context menu** (three dots), and select **Delete**.

---

## Key Takeaways
1. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Conditional Access provides dynamic controls for protecting sensitive resources.
2. **Custom Policies**:
   - Policies can be tailored to specific users, groups, or scenarios.
3. **Comprehensive Controls**:
   - Go beyond basic MFA by integrating signals like location and device compliance.

---

## Summary
- This lab covered the creation, testing, and cleanup of a Conditional Access policy in Microsoft Entra ID.
- Conditional Access is a robust security feature for managing access to Azure resources dynamically based on conditions.
- Advanced Conditional Access features require **Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 licenses**.
