## Overview
- **Defense in Depth**:
  - A security approach that applies protection measures at every layer of infrastructure, applications, and data.
  - Ensures multiple layers of defense to protect against threats.

## Layers of Defense in Depth

### 1. **Physical Security**
- Azure data centers implement protocols to secure physical infrastructure.
- Includes:
  - Controlled access for authorized personnel only.
  - Security measures for physical hardware.

### 2. **Perimeter and Network Security**
- Protection at the network level through:
  - Firewalls.
  - Network segmentation.
  - Intrusion detection and prevention systems.

### 3. **Identity and Access Management**
- Engineers working in data centers have restricted access to physical and virtual resources based on identity verification.

### 4. **Compute Layer Security**
- Example: Virtual machines (VMs).
- Measures include:
  - **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** to limit inbound and outbound traffic.
  - Regular application of **security patches**.
  - Installation of **endpoint security solutions**.

### 5. **Application and Data Security**
- Ensure:
  - Proper encryption of data at rest and in transit.
  - Application-level security measures such as secure coding practices and vulnerability scanning.

## Key Principles
- Security should be implemented at **every layer**:
  - From the physical data center to the application and data.
- Use multiple layers of security to ensure comprehensive protection.
- Each layer complements the others, creating a robust defense strategy.

## Summary
- **Defense in Depth** involves securing:
  - Physical hardware.
  - Perimeter and network.
  - Compute resources (e.g., VMs).
  - Applications and data.
- **Objective**:
  - Protect against threats by implementing security at every layer.
- **Importance**:
  - A layered approach ensures redundancy, reducing the likelihood and impact of breaches.
